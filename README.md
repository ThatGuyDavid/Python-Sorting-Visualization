# Python-Sorting-Visualization
This project is a python algorithm sorting visualizer developed using the Pygame library. It displays three sorting algorithms, namely bubble, insertion, and merge, in a visual manner, allowing the user to choose between ascending or descending order. The user interface is straightforward, with buttons for each algorithm, ascending and descending order, start, and reset. As well as a section that displays the current algorithm and sorting order as part of the UI. The sorting process begins upon clicking on the algorithm button, visually showing the elements being sorted. The sorting direction can be changed by clicking on the corresponding button. The start and reset buttons enable the user to initiate or reset the sorting process as required. Overall, the project serves as an effective tool for visualizing the sorting process and illustrating the differences between different algorithms, with a user-friendly interface suitable for users of all experience levels.

Initial Screen with preshuffled list (Bubble Sort - Ascending by default)

# Start
Click on one of the three algorithm buttons (bubble, insertion, or merge) to select the sorting algorithm you want to visualize.
Then click on the "Start" button to begin the sorting process. You will see the elements being sorted in real-time.

# Order
Click on either the "Ascending" or "Descending" button to select the sorting order you prefer.

# Repeatabilty
Once the sorting process is complete, you can click on the "Reset" button to reset the sorting algorithm to a fresh data set.
Allowing for easy to use repeatabilty.
